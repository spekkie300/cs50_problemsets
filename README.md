# CS50 2025 Problemset solutions

These are my personal solutions to the problemsets of CS50 2025.
As I am actively working through the course, the repo will update with new solutions when they are done.


None of these are perfect, I'm aware I tend to prefer stateful solutions and have a habit of either over commenting or not commenting my code at all.
But they might help you. And if not then they are just here for me to look back at later and laugh at my stupid old self.
